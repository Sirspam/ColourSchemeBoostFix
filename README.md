# Fixed in Beat Saber 1.25.0

# ColourSchemeBoostFix
So BeatGames just sorta forgot to save the new boost colours in colours schemes, this mod fixes that.

***note: This mod saves boost colours into it's own config, rather than the game's player data. As a result whenever BeatGames decides to fix this issue and this mod becomes obsolete your boost colours will have to be manually set again.***

## Installation
[Install](https://bsmg.wiki/pc-modding.html#install-mods) the latest version of [ColourSchemeBoostFix](https://github.com/Sirspam/ColourSchemeBoostFix/releases/latest), no dependencies needed!
